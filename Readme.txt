Usage of Application ,one can check the process in real time to find out what process of
students struggling with in order to correct them. Remote tutors can also find out where
they are stumbling, making feedback easier. Classes and meetings like going around the
whiteboard with several people will be able to be done online
This is an application which can be used for two way communication. In the world of the
pandemic where the face to face meeting and classes are affected this application can be
used to communicate in this situation. The application provides a feature where one
member has to create a room and other member join the room. Both image and text chat
option are available in the application. During the meeting or class members can in real time
share the image of the sheet where one is writing or drawing. Also one can take a picture of
the sheet and the picture is shared with all member. For the creation of room firebase was
used. When we click a photo we need to erase the background, for this we used
binarization. Using the binarization technique we eliminated the white background of the
picture so that only the written or drawn part is visible. One the image is binarized it is send
to the members. Then anyone who wants to append his/her side in the same image can do
so which is implemented by image overlay method. Thus the members interaction can be a
two way communication.
We used Android, Java, Firebase, Python, OpenCv, XML for completion of the Application.
The project is divided into the following major parts –
Step 1 -
Create a room.Other member join the room.After the meeting is started one can chat with
other members and also send images in other tab which is visible in the room itself.
Step 2 -
ChatRoom – ImageRoom. In ChatRoom you can chat as usual.In ImageRoom you can send
images likes flowgraph..Click the photo and send it.
Step 3 -
Send a binarized image to all users who open same room.Transparentize the white part of
binarized image and display camera image under the binarized image.The camera capture is
binarized again, and the two binarized images are overlaid.This process can be repeated
many times.those images.
Step 4 –
Send images from your camera to users of room.You can now control which images are
displayed on your camera or on the other party’s camera.
There are a variety of tools like boards that can be edited together in the world, the most
important thing was to be able to share handwritten items in real time and edit them on the
spot, so we focused on that point. Rather than single direction correspondence like onrequest conveyance, this application can without much of a stretch and very much impart
progressively with any individual who has white paper, dark pen, and cell phone.
